Project Overview:
=================


In this project, I have investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect.

I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then I performed the task by myself.

I then  collected some data from others who have performed the same task and have computed some statistics describing the results. 

Finally, I have provided my results in terms of your hypotheses.
